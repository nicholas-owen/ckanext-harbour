Most data on this portal is published under the understanding that it will be used free of charge by individuals, businesses and other organisations under the Open Government Licence or broadly equivalent regimes. However several data sets are subject to their own licensing agreement. Please check the information published with each data set.

### Licensing
Data published by Harbour Explorer is open for you to reuse within the parameters set by the licensing terms and conditions that relate to the individual datasets you choose to access and download. Data held on linked websites will be subject to other licensing conditions.

It should be noted that the licensing applied on the portal only applies to datasets and not to any associated documentation uploaded to provide context or information. These continue to fall under UCL's copyright statement, below.

UCL excludes all representations, warranties, obligations and liabilities in relation to the Information to the maximum extent permitted by law. The council is not liable for any errors or omissions in the data and shall not be liable for any loss, injury or damage of any kind caused by its use. We do not guarantee the continued supply of the Information.

The licences you can expect to see on this site under which datasets are made available are outlined in more detail below.

[UK Open Government Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/)

The UK Government Licensing Framework (UKGLF) provides a policy and legal overview of the arrangements for licensing the use and re-use of public sector information, both in central government and the wider public sector. It sets out best practice, standardises the licensing principles for government information and recommends the Open Government Licence (OGL) as the default licence for public sector information.

The OGL is an implied licence. By using information made available under the licence you indicate that you have accepted its terms and conditions. There is no need to register or formally apply for a licence.

In addition, The Open Government Licence is intended to be interoperable with the Creative Commons and Open Data Commons Attribution licences that are recognised by the information community and used internationally.
